# Semantic HTML Homework Assignment

## Description

This assignment divides a webpage via semantic tags. These tags not only label elements based on where they are located, but also index the text within.
The HTML code would be more confusing to navigate without the semantic tags. In addition, these tags provide search indexing - which helps the page appear in online searches.

## Installation

Open the link (<https://anj-23.github.io/semantic-html/>), and observe the layout and information on the website.

## Usage

The website briefly describes the benefits of search indexing - from Search Engine Optimization (SEO), reputation management, to online marketing.
